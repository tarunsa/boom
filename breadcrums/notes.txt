Bootstrap Breadcrumb:
---------------------
*) A breadcrum is a navigation scheme that indicates current page's location to the user within a website or application.
   Breadcrumb navigation can greatly enhance the accesibility of the website having a large number of pages or complex 
   navigational hierarchy.

*) You can create strict breadcrumbs layouts with Bootstrap simply using the class .Breadcrumb on the lists
