Bootstrap 4 collapse:
--------------------------

*) Collapsibles are useful when you want to hide and show large amount of content.

*) The .collapse class indicates a Collapsible element, this is the content that will be
    shown or hidden with a click of a button  or link.

*) To control the Collapsible content, add the data-toggle ='collapse' attribute to  an <a> or a <button>
    element. Then add the data-target='#id' attribute to connect the button with the Collapsible content (div id='demo')

*) For <a> elements, you can see the href attribute instead of the data-target attribute.

*) By default, the Collapsible content  is hidden. However, You can add the .show class to show the content by default.

*) Collapsible content is often used to make an "accordion". Accordions are popular for content such as FAQs, product
overviews, etc. you can use Bootstrap cards to style the accordion.
